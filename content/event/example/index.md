summary: As a native of Jiangxi, I absolutely love this dish. It's spicy and flavorful, with a crispy exterior and tender interior.
abstract: 'Soak dried chili peppers and Sichuan peppercorns in water. Pre-fry the potatoes. Marinate the pork ribs with salt and ground Sichuan peppercorn for 30 minutes. Stir-fry the ribs with ginger and garlic over medium heat until golden. Add the soaked chili and Sichuan peppercorns, then the fried potatoes. Season with light soy sauce, a generous amount of sugar and chicken bouillon powder. Stir-fry thoroughly, then add garlic sprouts just before serving. This dish offers a perfect balance of spicy and savory flavors, with tender ribs and crispy potatoes.'
